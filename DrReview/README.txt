Some concerns since the app runs with Firebase:

1. The project has firebase components and the Firebase console is only accessible with my google email account and password. 
   There is a google-services json file in the app folder with the url. If something went wrong with the connection to firebase (If you 
   need to access the console) please email me for the credentials to my account. I swear the app works perfectly fine, I can present to 
   you if needed. :D

2. I also exported the data for the database in a json file which you can find in the main folder "drreview-6626b-default-rtdb-export"
